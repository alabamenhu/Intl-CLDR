=begin pod
This test is designed to spot check certain elements for alignment issues.
The serialized nature of data reading/writing makes it easy for off-by-one
or more elements which adjusting the encoding or loading structure.

English is currently the primary language used to test this one, as it's the most
feature complete and easiest for me to debug.

Because each section is loaded as a distinct chunk, each should be tested
individually to ensure correctness.
